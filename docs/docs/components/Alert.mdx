The `<Alert />` component provides feedback to the user that something has happened.

It has the attribute `role="alert"`, which means that when the component is rendered its content will also be read aloud to users with screen readers.

The Alert component includes predefined status codes and customizable colors and icons.

```js
import { Alert } from 'minerva-ui';
```

If status codes are supplied, the component will supply predefined colors and icons.

```jsx
<Stack>
  <Alert status="error" title="Whoa!">
    Something not great is happening
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="success" title="Congrats!">
    Something great is happening!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="warning">
    Something is happening that isn't bad yet, but might be soon.
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="info" title="Attention:">
    Something is happening and you should know about it.
  </Alert>
</Stack>
```

## Custom Colors / Icons

You can also supply your own colors and icons. The default theme includes [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/).

```jsx live
<Stack>
  <Alert
    icon="arrow-right-circle"
    bg="orange.200"
    title="Look out over there!"
  />
  <Alert icon="info" bg="green.100">
    Here is some information
  </Alert>
</Stack>
```
