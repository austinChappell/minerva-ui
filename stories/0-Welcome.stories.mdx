# Minerva UI

## Get started

Minerva UI is a reusable component library to help build UIs faster. This library aims to be highly composable, declarative and accessible.

## Install
`npm install --save minerva-ui`
or
`yarn add minerva-ui`

### Goals:
- Highly Composable
- Easy to customize

## Usage

First add the `<ThemeProvider />` and `<GlobalStyles />` to the root of your app:

GlobalStyles is optional but highly recommended. It includes the CSS reset and styles from [Tailwind CSS.](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight)

```jsx live=false
import { ThemeProvider, GlobalStyles } from 'minerva-ui';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    {/* optional but recommended */}
    <GlobalStyles />
  </ThemeProvider>
)
```

Then import components you want into your UI:

```js
import { Checkbox } from 'minerva-ui';
```

And use them:

```jsx
() => {
  const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState(false);
  return (
    <Checkbox
      checked={checked}
      onChange={() => setChecked(!checked)}
    >
      Stay Logged In
    </Checkbox>
  )
}
```

# Principles
The goal of this library is not to provide fully-styled, pre-packaged components that are difficult to customize. Instead we want to provide powerful primitive components that can be easily composed to build your UI.

However, since we also realize that many developers don't want to have to sink hours of time into building their own UI, we also feature many examples of common UI patterns that are built with Minerva.

They're designed to be copy and pasted into your codebase to help you get started, and they allow you to easily customize anything you need to down the road.

# Concepts
## Elements
In this library, components that extend familiar HTML elements (such as `<input />`) are categorized as **elements**.

**Elements are esigned to have the same API** you expect from the native input, with some additional functionality added (including style props).

```jsx
() => {
  const [name, setName] = React.useState('');

  return (
    <Input
      // these props will be passed down and work as expected for a native HTML input
      value={name}
      onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}
      placeholder="Extra Large Input"
      // you will also have access to additional props
      fontSize="2xl"
      borderRadius="lg"
    />
  )
}
```

## Components
More complex components are in the "components" section.

This is for batteries-included components that assume some default functionality, such as an `<InputField />` component that you can pass a label string to.
