# Minerva UI

## Get started

Minerva UI is a reusable component library to help build UIs faster. This library aims to be highly composable, declarative and accessible.

## Install
`npm install --save minerva-ui`
or
`yarn add minerva-ui`

### Goals:
- Highly Composable
- Easy to customize

## Usage

First add the `<ThemeProvider />` and `<GlobalStyles />` to the root of your app:

GlobalStyles is optional but highly recommended, it includes the CSS reset and styles from [Tailwind CSS.](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight)

```jsx live=false
import { ThemeProvider, GlobalStyles } from 'minerva-ui';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    {/* optional but recommended */}
    <GlobalStyles />
  </ThemeProvider>
)
```

Then import components you want into your UI:

```js
import { Checkbox } from 'minerva-ui';
```

And use them:

```jsx
() => {
  const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState(false);
  return (
    <Checkbox
      checked={checked}
      onChange={() => setChecked(!checked)}
    >
      Stay Logged In
    </Checkbox>
  )
}
```

# Concepts
## Elements
In this library, components that extend familiar HTML elements (such as `<input />`) are categorized as **elements**.

**Elements are esigned to have the same API** you expect from the native input, with some additional functionality added (including style props).

```jsx
() => {
  const [name, setName] = React.useState('');

  return (
    <Input
      // these props will be passed down and work as expected for a native HTML input
      value={name}
      onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}
      placeholder="Extra Large Input"
      // you will also have access to additional props
      fontSize="2xl"
      borderRadius="lg"
    />
  )
}
```

## Components
More complex components are in the "components" section.

This is for batteries-included components that assume some default functionality, such as an `<InputField />` component that you can pass a label string to.
