# Theming

The Minerva theme object follows the [Styled System spec](https://system-ui.com/theme/), with some more specific styles added to create styles for specific components.

These specific styles allow you to control different components and their different states. In the future we plan to connect this config with tools like Figma to easily generate themes from design systems.

## Default Theme

Minerva comes with a [default theme](https://github.com/cratebind/minerva-ui/blob/master/src/theme.ts) that you can use to show the styles from Storybook by default.

You can also extend these styles to customize them or provide your own style object:

```jsx live=false
import { ThemeProvider, defaultTheme } from 'minerva-ui';

const customTheme = {
  // spread the default theme if you want to extend them
  ...defaultTheme
  colors: {
    // make sure to spread nested objects like this
    // unless you are trying to override the entire object
    ...defaultTheme.colors,
    primary:  '#551A8B'
  }
}

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>
      {/* ...rest of your app */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

## Component Theming

Theme styles for specific components can be provided in your `theme` object:

```jsx
() => {
  const theme = {
    Button: {
      backgroundColor: 'midnightblue',
      color: '#fff'
    }
  }

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Button>Custom Button Styles</Button>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```
